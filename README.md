# BudgetBuilder
## Budget building, comparing and negotiating

### Purpose
- Create, collaborate, and gather feedback on budgets for multi-stakeholder public projects in the style of github.


### As a User, I want to:
- Build a budget in a web app with smart suggestions and tags
- Share budget for feedback from collaborators
- Host a feedback page where our budget can be forked and annotated
	- Allow collaborators to fork the budget, create issues and make pull requests
	- Visualize areas of agreement and disagreement on a forum view
	- Allow users to upvote budget suggestions and come to a compromise
- Verify users as experts
  
  
### Third Party APIs
